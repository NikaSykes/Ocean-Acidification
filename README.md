# Ocean-Acidification

# Introduction
This was a final project for an ocean enginering class.  
The scientific question this project asks is: Is the affect of ocean acidication different at different locations of the ocean?	

In order to invesigate this question, real world data from various locations was used.

data here
This project compaires the average ph levels at three different locations, Miami Florida, Hawaii and Bay of Bundby.
The data used for this project is from ...

software needed
This project was done using Jupyter notebook (Python 3 version), launched from Anaconda. 

For this project the ph levels were ploted to see the range of the ph levels at each location.
The average ph level at each location was calculated for comparison between locations.

Here is a sample of the results: this is the graph of the ph levels recorded at ...


A special note: for data used in this project there were some readings of ph at -999. 
These can be persumed to have be outlyers and needed to be removed to not skew the data.
This was done using...
